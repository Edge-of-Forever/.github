# What is Edge of Forever?

Aside from the reference to the best episode of *Star Trek*'s original series ever to air?

Well, it's not much, really. Just a plan that never quite bore fruit. 

Edge of Forever was a different sort of FiveM server. It was a survival server, but there were no zombies, no plague, no nuclear winter, no apocalypse. Just the collapse of society as we know it. Gone were the fast cars and loose morals of Los Santos. The city was in ruins. The gangs took over. The land was occupied by Federal troops. The remaining survivors survived in small pockets in Blaine County.

## How did this happen?

In 2027, with the collapse of the economy of the United States of America, several states voted to secede from the Union. Among strongest of the the rebels is the newly formed **Republic of San Andreas**.

It didn't not take long for Federal troops to arrive. After siezing Fort Zancudo, an aircraft carrier was stationed off the sourhwestern coastline. A blockade was placed around the Port of Los Santos. LSIA is closed, all flights in or out were grounded. A trade embargo was established. All Federally insured banks were closed. All assets of residents were siezed. US currency was now worthless.

In response, police, fire, and EMS for the city of Los Santos walk off the job. Businesses were closed, all infrastructure had collapsed. Most citizens left the city, which was now in chaos. Riots had broken out among those that did not have the means to flee. Widespread looting was reported around the city. Fires burned out of control as well. It did not take long for gangs to carve up territory and begin fighting amongst themselves for territory.

Anyone wishing to stay alive evacuated Los Santos and headed for the hills to the relative safety of Blaine County. Motels and trailers became the best safe havens for refugees.

The Republic of San Andreas was an occupied country. Federal troops were on the ground trying to keep order among citizens. Rebel militia led raids on the Federal forces. Feds did their best to round up these militia groups. Standing orders from the American president were to capture if possible, kill if necessary. The President realizes these opposing rebel forces were our kin, our families, and our neighbors. It was the Civil War all over again. The President said he wanted to avoid bloodshed if at all possible.

He **said** that. He certainly did not live up to that statement.

For the first time, residents of San Andreas were truly on their own. There was no power, there was very little food or fresh water. Fuel was very scarce. Generators were available in some areas, but fuel was almost impossible to come by. The residents were forced to work together for farming, hunting, mining, and gathering resources. Plus they had to survive attacks from other factions. All this was under the thumb of an occupying army of Federal forces.

## Do you have what it takes to survive?

- Federal troops established roadblocks and curfews as the occupation tightens the grip on the rebels holed up around Blaine County.
- Local economy depended on scavanging, crafting and barter. 
- Farming, hunting, and gathering resources was now a way of life. Residents had to craft everything that they once relied on regular shipments to provide. This included
  - Drinking water
  - Food for stores
  - Bio fuels
  - Metals for crafting
  - Gold ingots used for currency
- Banks and cash no longer exist. 
- Travel to the city of Los Santos is discouraged. 
- Regular armed convoys were required to secure fuemanufactured goods and refined foods.
- Armed convoys helped to fight off gangs and raids from other factions.
- The airport in Sandy Shores is the only legal way in and out of the area, but it was crawling with Federal troops.
- The airstrip in Grapeseed was the only place where black market goods can be imported.
- Federals infiltrated society at every level of the Republic. 
- Would you able to tell friend from foe? 
- Could you quickly determine between spies and trusted friends?

## This is not your father's San Andreas
No supercars. No life of crime. No thug life. Just survival.

## It was *Development Hell*

I am not a developer. I was doing all of this on my own and it was very slow going. Over nearly two years, I never made any serious progress. This was not something I could just plug into anm existing economy framework. Much of the backend had to be designed and built from the ground up. And I couldn't write `Hello World` without stuff breaking.

### Maybe someday it will happen
