Edge of Forever is a different sort of [FiveM][1] server. It's a survival server, but there are no zombies, no plague, no nuclear winter, no apocalypse. Just the collapse of society as we know it. Gone are the fast cars and loose morals of Los Santos. The city is in ruins. The gangs have taken over. The land is occupied by Federal troops. The strong survive in small pockets in Blaine County.

## How did this happen?

In 2027, with the collapse of the economy of the United States of America, several states voted to secede from the Union. Among strongest of the the rebels is the newly formed **Republic of San Andreas**.

It doesn't not take long for Federal troops to arrive. After siezing Fort Zancudo, an aircraft carrier is stationed off the sourhwestern coastline. A blockade is placed around the Port of Los Santos. LSIA is closed, all flights in or out are grounded. A trade embargo is established. All Federally insured banks are closed. All assets of residents are siezed. US currency is now worthless.

In response, police, fire, and EMS for the city of Los Santos walk off the job. Businesses close,all infrastructure collapsed. Most citizens leave the city, and riots break out among those that do not have the means to flee. Widespread looting is reported around the city. Fires burn out of control as well. It does not take long for gangs to carve up territory and begin fighting amongst themselves for territory.

Anyone wishing to stay alive evacuated Los Santos and headed for the hills and relative safety of Blaine County. Motels and trailers become the best safe havens for refugees.

The Republic of San Andreas is an occupied country. Federal troops are now on the ground trying to keep order among citizens. Rebel militia lead raids on the Fedeal forces. Feds do their best to round up these militia groups. Standing orders from the American president are capture if possible, kill only if necessary. The President realizes these opposing rebel forces are our kin, our families, and our neighbors. It's a Civil War all over again. And the President wants to avoid bloodshed if at all possible.

For the first time, residents are truly on their own. There's no power, there's very little food or fresh water. Fuel is very scarce. Generators are available in some areas, but fuel is almost impossible to come by. The residents must work together for farming, hunting, mining, and gathering resources. Plus they must survive attacks from other factions. All under the thumb of an occupying army of Federal forces.

## Do you have what it takes to survive?

- Federal troops have established roadblocks and curfews as the occupation tightens the grip on the rebels holed up around Blaine County.
- Farming, hunting, and gathering resources is now a way of life. Residents must craft everything that they once relied on regular shipments to provide. This includes
  - Drinking water
  - Food for stores
  - Bio fuels
  - Metals for crafting
  - Gold ingots are use for currency
- Regular armed convoys are required to secure manufactured goods and refined foods. These convoys must fight off gangs and raids from other factions.
- The airport in Sandy Shores is the only legal way in and out of the area, but it's crawling with Federal troops.
- The airstrip in Grapeseed is the only place where black market goods can be imported.
- Federals have infiltrated every level of society among the residents of the Republic. Can you tell friend from foe? Who's a spy and who's a trusted friend?

## Under active development

Be warned, it's very very early alpha testing phase. The economy framework is [ND Framework v2.0+][5] with heavy reliance on [Ox Inventory][6]. The economy is dependent on crafting and barter. Banks and cash no longer exist. Travel to the city of Los Santos is discouraged. In the future, there may be organized convoy missions to the port and airport to secure fuel and goods. But for now, we'll stay in the north of the island.
